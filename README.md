# Environmental_Disaster-_Prediction-
Environmental Disaster Prediction This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of environmental disasters (e.g., floods, wildfires) based on various environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed. The goal is to create a predictive model that helps forecast potential disaster risks, providing timely insights for early warning and disaster preparedness.  Features: Logistic Regression for binary classification (disaster vs. no disaster).  Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset).  Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.  User-friendly web interface for inputting environmental data and displaying prediction results.  Technologies Used: Backend: Java Spring Boot for handling the prediction API.  Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for user input and result display.  Machine Learning: Python, Scikit-learn for training the logistic regression model.  How to Run: Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/environmental-disaster-prediction.git  Set up Backend: Run the Spring Boot application to expose the prediction API.  Set up Frontend: Place the HTML, CSS, and JS files in the Spring Boot projectâ€™s static folder.  Run the Application: Access the application via http://localhost:8080 to input environmental data and predict disaster risks.  Future Work: Implement additional machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM).  Enhance the UI/UX for better interaction and visualization.  Integrate real-time weather data for live predictions.  Feel free to modify it based on your project details!
